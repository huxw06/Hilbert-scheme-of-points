# Hilbert-scheme-of-points
This repository contains  files accompanying my paper on local structures of Hilbert scheme of points: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05236.
A sample using the Macaulay2 codes to compute the local equation associating with the 3D partition (1)\subset (4,1) (see Appendix A.1 of arxiv.org/abs/2101.05236) is given in the file hilb_scheme_6points_sing(1)in(4,1)_haiman_equation_change_of_coordinates
