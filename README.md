# Hilbert-scheme-of-points
This repository contains  files accompanying my paper on local structures of Hilbert scheme of points: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05236.

A sample using the Macaulay2 codes to compute the local equation associating with the 3D partition (1)\subset (4,1) (see Appendix A.1 of loc. cit) is given in the file hilb_scheme_6points_sing(1)in(4,1)_haiman_equation_change_of_coordinates.

The Mathematica codes are used for verifying the summation of the localization contributions in the proof of Proposition 5.8 of loc. cit. The final verification for 6 points is Out[211] in Hilbert_scheme_extradim=6_points_Contribution.pdf, and that for 7 points is Out[300] in Hilbert_scheme_extradim=6_points_Contribution.pdf.
