# Hilbert-scheme-of-points
This repository contains  files accompanying my paper on local structures of Hilbert scheme of points: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05236.

An example illustrating the use of the Macaulay2 codes to compute the local equation associating with the 3D partition (1)\subset (4,1) (see Appendix A.1 of loc. cit) is given in the file hilb_scheme_6points_sing(1)in(4,1)_haiman_equation_change_of_coordinates. The final output o80 gives the equation (88) of loc. cit.

The Mathematica codes are used for verifying the summation of the localization contributions in the proof of Proposition 5.8 of loc. cit. The final verification for 6 points is Out[211] in Hilbert_scheme_extradim=6_points_Contribution.pdf, and that for 7 points is Out[300] in Hilbert_scheme_extradim=6_points_Contribution.pdf.
